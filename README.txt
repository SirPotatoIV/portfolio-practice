Title: Jake O'Toole's Portfolio

Description: This project was created to develop my skills related to HTML and CSS by creating a mock portfolio website. This is a homework assignment for a web developer bootcamp.

Installation: If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project.

Usage: The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML and CSS. It could be used as a template for a portflio site, but I wouldn't recommend.

Credits: I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services.

Contributing: I was the only one to work on this project.
