Title: Jake O'Toole's Portfolio

Description: This project was created to develop my skills related to HTML and CSS by creating a mock portfolio website. This is a homework assignment for a web developer bootcamp.

Installation: If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project.

Usage: The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML and CSS. It could be used as a template for a portflio site, but I wouldn't recommend.

Credits: I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services. Credits for images and background are located in the html or css. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. These have also been cited.

Contributing: I was the only one to work on this project.

Challenges: I struggled with flex the most. I realized it was causing my text to wrap when the window was shrunk and certain divs to not take up the whole page if flex was not applied correctly. Combining flex and positing attributes also created several layers of frustration. I also learned that even though I used a css link to reset the css, the element button was still affected by the browser. I used css-tricks to find a tutorial on how to remove the styling.
